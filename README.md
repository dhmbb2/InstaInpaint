# InstaInpaint: Instant 3D-Scene Inpainting with Masked Large Reconstruction Model
Junqi You, Chieh Hubert Lin, Weijie Lyu, Zhengbo Zhang, Ming-Hsuan Yang

We propose **InstaInpaint**, a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. InstaInpaint achieves a 1000Ã— speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks.
